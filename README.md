# React Task Tracker

## Features

- **JSX:** Used to write HTML within JavaScript, making the UI code easy to understand.
- **Components:** The app is divided into reusable components like `Header`, `Task`, and `AddTask`.
- **Props & Prop Passing:** Data is passed between components using props, allowing for dynamic and flexible UI.
- **useState:** Manages the state of tasks and other UI elements.
- **useReducer:** Offers better control for handling actions in state management.
- **Context API:** Passes down state and functions to deeply nested components without prop drilling.
- **Local Storage:** Persists task data using the browser's local storage, ensuring tasks remain after a page refresh.
